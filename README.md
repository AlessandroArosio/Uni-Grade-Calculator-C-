# Uni-Grade-Calculator-C-
Enhanced version of my Python calculator

As per title, I re-build my Python grade calculator in C++ with some changes in the code.
This will ask the module name and store it in a vector on the heap. Then the user can input the grade obtained during a course work and its weighting. A nested do-while loop will add the weighted grades in a variable and then store it in another vector.
Eventually, the for loop will return al the values stored in the two vectors.
